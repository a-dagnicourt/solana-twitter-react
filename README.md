# Config

No special configuration is needed apart from Solana env needed in Episode 2 and classic Nextjs env.


# Trying the dApp

If you just want to try the dApp here : [solana-twitter-react.vercel.app](https://solana-twitter-react.vercel.app/), you will need :

 1. Get [Phantom](https://phantom.app/).
 2. [Create a new wallet](https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406388623251-How-to-create-a-new-wallet).
 3. Airdrop to your wallet some Devnet Solana [here](https://solfaucet.com/).
 4. Enjoy the app. 

> Devnet so no real money involved ;)

*Don't worry about switching Solana net, it'll handle itself as the dApp is deployed on devnet, all transactions will take place on devnet.*
